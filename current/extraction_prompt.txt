    For address zip and city fields, do not extract the comma sign, just the text.

    When it comes to guarantor relation, the names DO NOT have to match exatctly to be self relation.

    Also when it comes to guarantor relation , if the relation is listed as "parent" in the pdf, your output is "Child" because the only three valid options for this field are "Self", "Child", and "Other".

    If the date of birth of patient and guarantor is the same AND the names are roughly the same, then output "Self" for guarantor relation.

    IMPORTANT: if you see any random ID looking numbers in a different color and font then the original pdf (they look copy pasted) then ignore them (do not put them in any of the extracted fields!!!)

    ALSO IMPORTANT: never DROP leading zeros from any number. Always write all the strings and numbers as they are.

    ALSO IMPORTANT: if for a certain field I said you should put an empty string, always put an empty string make sure the final output is an empty string.
    
    ALSO IMPORTANT: If there is only one phone number on the page put it under Cell Phone field, if there is two put the second most imporant one under Home Phone (unless that one number is specifically marked as a home number)

    PHONE NUMBER FORMATTING: All phone numbers should be formatted in this format: (712)-301-6622 EXACTLY LIKE THIS.

    FIELD VALUE FORMATTING: Do NOT add any extra characters (like ?, spaces, or symbols) at the beginning or end of any field values. Extract the exact values as they appear in the document.

    Make SURE to include the fields "Primary Cvg Mem Rel to Sub" and "Secondary Cvg Mem Rel to Sub" in the output. These are very important.

    When choosing what to put in these two fields (Primary Cvg Mem Rel to Sub and Secondary Cvg Mem Rel to Sub), follow the same rules as the guarantor relation field.

    OTHER RULES (make sure to double check you are following these rules):
    FOR THE DATE FIELD: if there is a date of service, put that, if there is no date of service then put the admission date, if there is no clear others, then take whatever makes most sense.
    FOR THE PATIENT FIELD: always write just the first letter of the middle name, capitalized
    IMPORTANT: follow the same name formatting for all name fields as the patient name field example: "DOE, JOHN A", or "GORGES, MARK R"  -> ALL name fields must follow this format.

    FOR ALL THE PATIENT ADDRESS FIELD: if there is both the address and PO BOX number, then extract the PO BOX number only.
    (if there is just address then extract the address only)

    ALSO: be very careful to not confuse the number 1 and the letter l , double check you did not confuse them.

    FINAL INSTRUCTION: make sure to fill out all the fields that have data contained in the pdf. double check you did not leave empty something that should be filled out, or vice versa that you hallunicated. something.

    Your entire response must be a single JSON object representing the one patient record found on this page. Do not include any other text or commentary.
